The **climex** package is getting overhauled. Please check out the
branch
[climatic-new-features](https://gitlab.com/theGreatWhiteShark/climex/tree/climatic-new-features)
for the most recent version (almost at production level).

The new version will **not** contain all features of the previous ones
anymore. The *import of the DWD data* will be shifted to the
[dwd2r](https://gitlab.com/theGreatWhiteShark/dwd2r) and the graphical
user interfaces is outsourced into the
[climexUI](https://gitlab.com/theGreatWhiteShark/climexUI) package.
