\title{Plots the GEV likelihood}
\usage{
likelihood.plot(time.series, location.lim = NULL, scale.lim = NULL,
  shape.lim = NULL, center = NULL, initial = NULL, main = NULL,
  true.minima = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{time.series}{Data, for which the likelihood function is
going to be calculated.}

\item{location.lim}{Boundaries of the plotted likelihood
region. Default = +/- 2.5 times the minimum value.}

\item{scale.lim}{Boundaries of the plotted likelihood
region. Default = +/- 2.5 times the minimum value.}

\item{shape.lim}{Boundaries of the plotted likelihood
region. Default = +/- 2.5 times the minimum value.}

\item{center}{It set this point (3D) will be the new center of the
likelihood plot. Default = NULL}

\item{initial}{Initial parameters which can be provided for the
fit of the time series.}

\item{main}{Title for the multiplot. Default = NULL.}

\item{true.minima}{Provide the true minima of the neg
log-likelihood function if \code{\link{fit.gev}} does not
provide it in the first run. Default = NULL.}
}
\value{
returns a multiplot of planes through the negative
  log-likelihood of the GEV function calculated using the input
  time series.
}
\description{
Generates three 2D slices of the likelihood of a
  provided time series.
}
\details{
The likelihood will be plotted around its optimal
  value. To determine it the time series will be fitted via
  \code{\link{fit.gev}}. Its also possible to provide another
  point the likelihood will be centered around using
  \strong{center}.

  The likelihood will be calculated using the C++-based function
  \strong{likelihood_GEV}.
