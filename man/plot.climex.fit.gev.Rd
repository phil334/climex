\usage{
\method{plot}{climex.fit.gev}(x, bin.factor = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Fitted GEV object of class \emph{climex.fit.gev}.}

\item{bin.factor}{Multiplying the length of \strong{x} by this
factor, results in the number of bins used in this plot. Default
= NULL}

\item{...}{Additional parameters. They won't be handled in the

\description{

  \code{\link{fit.gev}}
}
\details{
Uses \pkg{ggplot2}.

  Since this function is also uses in the shiny app
